# Sketch Toolbox

An __extremely early__ prototype of a package manager for Sketch.app (only an evening's work so far). 

Over the next few days, I'll be doing a lot of polishing of the interface and experience, as well as refactoring the code. There's a ton of room for improvement, I just wanted to get something rudimentary out.

Please feel free to get involved if you're interested! You can email me at me @ shahr.uz or find me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/shahruz).
