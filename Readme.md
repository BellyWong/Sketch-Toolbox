# Sketch Toolbox

An *extremely early* prototype of a package manager for Sketch.app. Currently, the app will download packages to Sketch. 

Over the next few days, I'll be adding in auto-updating functionality, along with a more polished interface (with the ability to search, organize by plugins already downloaded, etc.) 

I'll also likely be refactoring much of the code into something more easily maintainable if there's interest. (It's fairly rough right now.)

Please feel free to get involved if you're interested! You can email me at me @ shahr.uz or find me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/shahruz)
